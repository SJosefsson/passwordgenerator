# Password Generator
A short password generator program, that asks how many characters long you want your password to be, then generates one and prints it.
It can also take one integer as argument if the program is called from the terminal window, and just generate a password with length equal to the integer argument.

It currently generates passwords with a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and many special characters in it.
